    save_model(model::TransformerModel, processor::TimeSeriesProcessor, filename::String)

Save a trained model and processor to a file.

# Arguments
- `model`: Trained TransformerModel
- `processor`: TimeSeriesProcessor with clustering data  
- `filename`: Path to save the model (should end with .jld2)

# Example
```julia
save_model(trained_model, processor, "my_transformer.jld2")
